# Building Systems with the ChatGPT API

Andrew Ng and Isa Fulford's released great course called ["Building Systems with the ChatGPT API"](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/chatgpt-building-system/) on DeepLearning.AI site.

I've followed on-screen instructions to re-create their practical Jupyter notebooks and then adapted the code to run against Azure OpenAI service, as it has slightly different syntax in comparison to the original OpenAI endpoints:
1. Language Models, the Chat Format and Tokens;
2. Classification;
3. Moderation;
4. Chain of Thoughts;
5. Chaining Prompts;
6. Check Outputs;
7. Build an End-to-End System;
8. Evaluation - Part 1;
9. Evaluation - Part 2.
